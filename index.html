                <h1> Introduction </h1>
                <p> 
                    There has been a lot of hype in recent years regarding renewable energy, 
                    with activists such as Greta Thunberg spearheading protests against practices that are harmful to the environment, 
                    and governments pledging to turn away from fossil fuels to utilise more renewable sources of energy. 
                <br><br>
                    Closer to home, the Singapore government has also launched the SG Green Plan 2030 in 2021, 
                    with a set of targets to turn Singapore into a cleaner and greener country. 
                    But as the stipulated deadline looms, I aim to find out what is Singapore's progress in making those targets a reality.

                <h1>Aren't they the same? </h1>
                <p>Well, there is a difference actually. </p>
                <!-- do table on definitions -->
                <table class = "definition" style="width:100%">
                    <tr>
                    <th>Clean Energy</th>
                    <th>Green Energy</th>
                    <th>Renewable Energy</th>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                    <td>Clean energy produces electricity without emissions.</td>
                    <td>Green energy comes from totally natural sources, which have low or no environmental impact in their creation or use.</td>
                    <td>Energy derived from natural sources that are replenished at a higher rate than they are consumed</td>
                    </tr>
                </table><br>
                <p>Do they sound similar? Well, a key difference is that while most green energy sources are also renewable, 
                    not all renewable energy sources are considered entirely green.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Take hydropower for example. Hydropower involves the use of water to generate electricity, and is thus considered a form of renewable energy source. 
                    However, many have argued that hydropower cannot be considered a form green energy due to the industrialisation and large amounts of deforestation
                    needed to build the massive hydro dams. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Some examples of green energy sources that are also sources of renewable energy include:

                    Just as how we have the four National taps in Singapore,

                        Natural gas is a fossil fuel. Similar to other fossil fuels such as coal and oil, natural gas forms from plants, 
                        animals, and microorganisms that lived on earth millions of years ago.
                        About 95% of Singapore’s electricity is generated using natural gas, the cleanest form of fossil fuel.

                        Currently holds the top spot as the most promising renewable energy source in the near term for Singapore
                        Constraints: due to Singapore’s scarce land area, the amount of solar energy that can be harnessed is limited. 
                        Even as we work towards achieving our 2030 solar target of 2GWp, it will constitute only around 3% of the country’s total projected electricity demand in 2030.

                        This method helps diversify our energy sources away from natural gas, improving Singapore's energy resilience. 
                        Obtaining regional power grids are mainly done through bilateral cooperation or regional initiatives.

                        Singapore is constantly exploring emerging low-carbon solutions. Lower carbon alternatives include  
                        novel sources such as hydrogen and carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS). 
                        Depending on technological developments and the development of other energy sources, 
                        hydrogen could supply up to half of our power needs by 2050.
                        This would then help reduce Singapore's carbon footprint in the longer term.

                    Singapore is a relatively small country, with neither land space for windmills, nor a river system with fast flowing water.

                <h2>
                    According to the National Climate Change Secretariat (NCCS),
                </h2>
                <ul> 
                    <li>Commercial wind turbines operate at wind speeds of around above 4.5m/s</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>In stark contrast to Singapore, where the average wind speed is only about 2m/s</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <li>Being a trade-reliant country, most of the sea space is used for ports, anchorage and shipping lanes</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>This results in insufficient space for tidal power generation</li>

                <br>
                <p> 
                    This crosses out both wind power and hydropower respectively, leaving us with solar power.

                        As seen from the graphs above, the number of solar panels installed in Singapore has been on the rise, 
                        from 30 in 2008 to 5,455 in the first quarter of 2022. In the same vein, the capacity of solar panels have also increased, 
                        from 0.4MWp in 2008 to 670MWp in the first quarter of 2022.

                    <p>
                        As solar panels continue to be installed all across Singapore, from HDB rooftops to our local water bodies, 
                        such as at Tengeh Reservoir, we can expect to see an even greater expansion in the amount and use of solar 
                        panels in the years to come.

                    As of March 2023, there are around 2,000 charging points available in Singapore, 
                    including both public and private charging stations. 
                    This means that there is still a long way to go to reach the ambitious target of 60,000 charging points by 2030. 
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    However, with the government's continued efforts and support, 
                    it is hoped that Singapore will be able to achieve this target and further promote the adoption 
                    of electric vehicles in the country.

                        Tesla began selling its electric vehicles in Singapore in 2017, and it currently offers several models,

                    Well, these are just the tip of the iceberg in Singapore’s EV scene. 
                    But other than for private use, where can EVs be seen in the public sector?

                <p> 
                    From here, we can see that the number of electric vehicles used by Singaporeans has increased exponentially, 
                    although they still constitute a small proportion of the total motor vehicles used in Singapore. 
                    Yet, we can continue to expect that with an even greater increase in awareness of the benefits of electric vehicles, 
                    as well as the proliferation of electric vehicle suppliers with the continued support from the government, 
                    these numbers are bound to increase even more.

                <h1>Conclusion</h1>
                <p> 
                    We began by asking the question, "How has Singapore progressed in transitioning to renewable energy, 
                    and how close is it to achieving its SGP2030 targets?"
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    After addressing common misconceptions in the different types of energy, exploring Singapore's main energy sources and delving into
                    Singapore's current consumption patterns over the years, Singapore still seems to be a far cry from achieving its SGP2030 goals
                    at the current moment. 
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    Yet, not all is lost, as we’ve seen some huge leaps in the renewable energy sector, 
                    especially with regards to solar energy and electric vehicles. 
                    For a land scarce city-state as Singapore, the targets may still seem ambitiously high for now, 
                    but we can expect to see greater steps taken by the government and relevant sectors as they sign more 
                    leases in the coming years to enable improvements in renewable energy infrastructure.
